## Watch App Log Collection

To collect logs from your Android Watch app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before collecting logs, ensure your watch is:
- **Connected to Wi-Fi** - Logs are uploaded via Wi-Fi, so a stable connection is required
- **Connected to Charging** - The log collection process requires the watch to be charging

### Steps

1. On your watch, open the **Bridge** app
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Collect Logs**
3. Select **Collect Logs** to begin the collection process

> **Important Note:** The app will automatically close when you select "Collect Logs". This is expected behavior. You will need to manually restart the Bridge app after the log collection is complete.

4. Once the app has closed, restart the Bridge app manually
5. Wait for the logs to be uploaded. Keep your watch connected to Wi-Fi and charging for **10-15 minutes**. Our app uses Firebase Analytics, which decides on its own when is the right time to upload the logs. The logs are uploaded only after the app is restarted.

## iOS App Log Submission

To submit logs from the iOS app:

1. Open the **Bridge** app on your iPhone
2. Navigate to the **Settings** menu
3. Tap on **Send Feedback**
4. Follow the prompts to submit your feedback and logs

The logs will be automatically included with your feedback submission.

## Submit Device ID

After collecting logs from either or both apps, please submit your Device ID to our support team using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Reddit
- Send a direct message (DM) to **r/orienlabs** on Reddit

### Option 2: Email
- Email us at **bridge@olabs.app**

### Important Information to Include

When submitting your logs, please provide:

1. **Device ID** - This can be found on the watch app's main screen, displayed just below the iPhone name. You can either:
   - Copy and paste the Device ID, or
   - Provide a screenshot of the main screen showing the Device ID

2. **Description of the Issue** - A brief description of what problem you're experiencing

3. **Steps to Reproduce** (if applicable) - What actions led to the issue

> **Tip:** Taking a screenshot of the watch app's main screen is the easiest way to capture the Device ID, as it's clearly visible below the iPhone name.
